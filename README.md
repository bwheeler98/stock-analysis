# Green Stock Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use VBA scripting to make analyzing stock data in Excel more efficient.  VBA allows us to write a script that performs an analysis on each stock without manually entering the same formulas for each stock.  Steve initially wanted to review 12 green energy stocks for his parents and the initial VBA code worked, but could be more efficient.  The refactored code is faster and by adding a few more array variables Steve is now able to easily expand his analysis to other stocks, not just the selceted green energy stocks.  

### Results
The selected green energy stocks had a much better year in 2017 than they did in 2018.  In 2017, all but one stock made money (positive return).  The stock with the biggest return was DQ at 199.4% return.  In 2018, only two stocks had a positive return.  RUN had the best return at 84%.  In regards to the actual code, the refactored code ran a lot faster than the original code.  The reason the refactored code is better and faster is because we added three new array variables as well as the tickerIndex variable.
